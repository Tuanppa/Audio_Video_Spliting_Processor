00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
The bear and the bee.

00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,860
A version of the tale by thefablecottage .com

3
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,339
Everybody knows that bears love honey.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,880
One day Mr.

5
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,859
Bear looks in his cupboard and he can't find any honey.

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,980
Oh no, no honey, he says.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,920
So he goes into the forest to find some.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,479
He sees a beehive in a tree.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,420
He smells the honey.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,859
Mmm, honey.

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:49,679
He sticks his paw into the beehive and A bee flies out.

12
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,539
Hey bear, go away.

13
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:53,939
Says the bee.

14
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:56,380
This is not your honey.

15
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,020
Mr.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,020
Bear is annoyed.

17
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,799
I am bigger than you.

18
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:02,859
He says.

19
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,900
And I am stronger than you too.

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,200
I can do what I want.

21
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,579
Now buzz off.

22
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:10,959
Mr.

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:19,500
Bear sticks his paw into the beehive again and Owie.

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,040
The bee stings him right on his nose.

25
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,560
My nose, my nose.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,219
I am so angry.

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,900
Growls Mr.

28
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,200
Bear.

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,379
He finds a big stick.

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,000
He tries to hit the bee.

31
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,420
He swings and he swings.

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,659
But the bee is too fast.

33
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:43,299
Mr.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,879
Bear gets angrier and angrier.

35
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,459
I will squash you.

36
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:51,700
Come here.

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,819
The bee flies back into the beehive.

38
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,560
Oh, no, you are trapped.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,900
yells Mr.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,140
Bear.

41
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:03,379
He swings his stick at the beehive.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,000
Smash, smash, smash.

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,560
He smashes it to pieces.

44
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,090
Then he hears a strange sound.

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,539
It gets louder and louder.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,659
Thousands of bees fly out of the smashed beehive.

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,939
They fly around Mr.

48
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:29,719
Bear's head.

49
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,120
They sting him on his ear.

50
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,520
They sting him on his elbow.

51
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,460
They chase Mr.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,639
Bear through the forest.

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,719
They sting him on his arms, his legs, his hands, and especially on his nose.

54
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:52,819
Mr.

55
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,500
Bear runs all the way home and slams the door shut.

56
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,479
Bam!

57
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,879
Then he hears a voice behind him.

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,500
It's Mrs.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:03,900
Bear.

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,659
You did it again, didn't you?

61
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,680
She says, You lost your temper.

62
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,439
Yes.

63
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:16,000
He says as he cries and counts his bee stings.

64
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:20,180
Here's the bee sting medicine, says Mrs.

65
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:20,599
Bear.

66
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,560
Also, we have honey in the cupboard.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,500
It's behind the flower.

68
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,180
Moral.

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,879
A hot temper always gets you into trouble.
